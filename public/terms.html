                    >The Website is designed to provide an online resource for
                    reviewing Data and Analytics related to crypto assets. For
                    example, you may use the Website to obtain daily crypto
                    asset data sets of either crypto asset network or market
                    data (“Data”). You may also obtain correlations and other
                    derived analytics of the various Data that we or our
                    licensors have generated (“Analytics”). You may also
                    register with the Website to receive API data feeds of Data
                    and Analytics. We may also offer paid subscriptions for
                    products from time to time – if we do so, your use of such
                    products will be subject to a separate license agreement
                    between you and Godeye.</span

                    users that have a password or other access credentials such
                    as an API key. Please keep in mind that we will treat anyone
                    who uses your user name and password/access credentials as
                    “you.” We will provide this user with all of the rights and
                    privileges that we provide to you, and we will hold you
                    responsible for the activities of a person using your
                    account. Therefore, we recommend that you maintain your user
                    name and password/access credentials in confidence, and that
                    you refrain from disclosing this information to anyone
                    outside of your Organization who might “pretend” to be you
                    with respect to the Website and your participation in the
                    Services. For clarity, to the extent a single set of access
                    credentials (user name and password or API key) is
                    established for you / your Organization (“Access
                    Credentials”), these Access Credentials may be used by
                    authorized representatives within your Organization,
                    provided that you / your Organization remains responsible
                    for the use of the Website and any Godeye Content obtained
                    by anyone accessing the Website using your Access
                    Credentials. For the avoidance of doubt, you shall not
                    permit any third parties to access the Website using the
                    your Access Credentials. We also ask that you notify us
                    immediately if you suspect that someone is using your user
                    name and/or password and/or API key in this or any
                    inappropriate manner.</span
